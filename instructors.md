## Pacing

We moved through a lot of this material very quickly. The group was extremely
switched on, all came from the same lab, and experienced programmers were paired
with less experienced students. 


We broke for challenges only for the key programming concepts (i.e. loops, 
functions, control flow). Attendees were generally happy to follow along 
without challenges for the other topics, so we were able to cover a lot of
material. exposing attendees to concepts and packages they might find useful
later.
